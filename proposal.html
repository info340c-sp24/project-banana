            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p>The significance of accessible health resources is crucial, particularly for college students navigating independence for the first time. Many students are uncertain of where to find necessary health resources to protect their health and well-being. Being sick not only affects their health, but also could affect academic performance and overall well-being. Addressing this concern is essential for fostering a healthy college experience.</p>
            <p>An information technology problem in the space of UW is the lack of accessible, navigable health platforms that provide detailed information about available resources on or near campus. These issues could include problems such as real-time appointment availability for urgent care, clarity about insurance coverage vs. out-of-pocket payment options, or more filtered options based on the students health concerns. Students who dont have prior experiences navigating health resources may find it challenging to seek for such support, consequently, this could negatively impact their health further if assistance isnt received in a timely manner.</p>
            <p>MyUW has links to a few resources for student well-being on their <a href="https://my.uw.edu/husky_experience/">Husky experience toolkit page</a>. According to the website, the page aims to make the most out of their “Husky Experience”. The page consists of four sections that are supposed to address the interconnected dimensions of the Husky Experience: Know Yourself, Know the World, Make Your Way, and Weave it Together. The know yourself section has a list of links to pages that relate to individual student success and well-being. The relevant links include: “Eating for Better Mood and Energy”, “A Little Stress is Good. Really.”, “No Time to be Healthy?”</p>
            <p>The University of Washington's Well-Being for Life & Learning initiative, accessible at <a href="https://wellbeing.uw.edu">https://wellbeing.uw.edu</a>, is a comprehensive resource dedicated to supporting the holistic well-being of its students. This web app is designed to inform students about academic performance, personal development, and overall health by providing accessible, tailored well-being resources and services. The platform addresses several core areas of student life, including mental health, physical wellness, social connections, and academic success. Key features of the site include Mental Health Resources, Physical Health Guides, and Social Well-Being. Tools and services to aid in academic advising, career planning, and skill development are also provided. The web app aims to empower students to thrive in all aspects of their university experience by integrating well-being into the fabric of campus life.</p>
