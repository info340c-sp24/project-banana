            <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
            <section>
                <p>The main users of this application are UW students. This may impact minority groups positively as it provides equal access to information regarding nearby resources. However groups that have limited access to technology may find it difficult to utilize this app.</p>
                <p>The users will be able to search for health resources through our web app and see a history of their previous visits.</p>
                <p>Search feature:</p>
                <p>One of the main interactive features the website provides is a search function. The user can easily search for various resources within their location such as clinics and more. The search bar offers deeper interactivity with the ability to pin locations on the map, filtering by availability and needs, and sorting from closest to furthest.</p>
                <p>History tracker and well-being:</p>
                <p>Another main feature of our web-app will be a tracker of all previous visits the user has had. It will keep track of the date, time, location, type of service they received during that appointment. Additionally, there will be a section that prompts the user to add comments about how they were feeling during the visit and how they feel after as a way to track and express their emotional well-being.</p>
                <p>We intend to use Google Maps API as an external source. The users will be able to view precise locations of these resources such as health clinics or pharmacies. This API also offers route directions and ETAs to said specific location, operating hours, and contact information for that specific location. We hope to also implement maybe services that location offers and payment information as well.</p>

                <p>Our proposed web app solution will be geared to new and current UW students to provide them with available resources for their general well being and health. This includes nutrition, physical activity, study habits, social well-being, and mental health. One of the goals of our app is to ensure the content of the web application is engaging  for our users in order for them to actually apply these resources in real life. To enhance user engagement, we intend to integrate interactive features and personalized content tailored to individual user profiles. Unique features such as progress tracking mechanisms will be implemented to not only inform but also actively involve users in meeting their wellness goals. Furthermore, our commitment to accessibility and inclusivity ensures that all students, regardless of background or ability, have equal opportunity to benefit from our app. By continuously adapting our web app through user feedback, our app aims to evolve, ensuring its relevance and effectiveness in promoting a healthier, more balanced student lifestyle. </p>
